{% capture about %}
Software Reuse has been recognized as a key strategy to improve productivity and quality. For instance, during many years, technologies such as components, object orientation and feature-oriented programming have been proposed to promote reuse and achieve these benefits.

However, although these technologies may an enabler, recent studies shown that non-technical factors, such as organization, processes, and human involvement, appeared to be at least as important. In addition, while some companies have succeed applying some methods, replying these have resulted a challenging task. It is becoming very important understand how these non-technical factors may affect in-practice our proposals to achieve systematic reuse in software organizations.

The **Workshop on Experiences and Empirical Studies on Software Reuse** aims to be an space where researchers and practitioners can present their experiences and studies on the area of software reuse, discuss the challenges that must be overcame in non-academic environments and obtain feedback on how the corresponding empirical research may be conducted and improved.

#### Topics

* Empirical studies, experiments and case studies conducted in the domain of reuse, incl. technical and managerial aspect
* Empirical evaluations and comparisons of techniques, methods or methodologies for reuse and software product lines
* Analysis of Empirical Data and Repositories regarding reuse practices
* Repeatable experiments and experiences
* Methods and Techniques that can be applied to study reuse in academic and non-academic environments
* Design of secondary and tertiary studies (e.g., mapping studies and systematic literature reviews) regarding reuse
* Experiences and reports that evidence problems and failures implementing techniques for reuse and SPLE

### Workshop format
This workshop will have an hybrid format where we mix lightning talks, paper presentations, and working sessions, aiming to foster collaboration among researchers and practitioners. Thus the workshop will have three moments as follows:

* *Keynote talk*. 
A keynote talk from an expert on empirical software engineering regarding research on engineering practices and software reuse. This talk is intended to discuss common concerns of researchers in the area and to provide some general guidelines.

* *Papers presentation*.
The presentation of the accepted papers will continue after the keynote talk. Each one is discussed by a member of the program committee, who will give comments on the presented research and will lead a brief session of questions and answers.

* *Working session*.
In this sesion participants will discuss and how to continue and improve the research presented during the workshop how to collaborate each to the others.
